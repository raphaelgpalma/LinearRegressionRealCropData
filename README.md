This linear regression model 



This linear regression model was applied to data provided by the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) to predict future crop production. The USDA collects data on agricultural production, including information on climate, soil, fertilizer use, pests, and diseases, among other factors that affect production. This data is used to predict future production and help make decisions in the agricultural sector. The linear regression model was applied to this data to provide a way to predict future production based on available historical data.


Interestingly, it showed 100% accuracy.
